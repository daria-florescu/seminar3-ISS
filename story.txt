Setting: Evil Disneyland

You are a young 22 year old currently working a cashier job at Disneyland. It's a relatively normal day, except the fact that outside it's currently the worst thunderstorm in human history. The park is mostly empty, save for the evilest of clients, Hubert. Do you wish to go home (go to branch 1) or do you wish to remain working, thus earning triple your usual bonus salary? (go to branch 2)






























































Branch 2

You chose to remain and work. Hubert crashes out violently seeing your resolve, and transforms into a giant dragon. You are very scared, screaming like a little constipated girl, but then you realise you must make
a dificult choice. Will you use the power of anime and friendship to switch souls and become Hubert, chaining him inside your little body (go to Branch 2.1) or will you use all of your mothers stew to invoke the
 magical camel of bravery, Camil, and face your greatest fears (Go to Branch 2.2)
















 Branch 22
 Now that you chose to summon the magical Camil, you try to face your greatest fear and destroy Hubert the dragon, which is flying in circles and shooting flames everywhere. Camil, who has two heads and four humps is looking at you 
 with his three yellow glowing eyes and is waiting for you to give him an order. You say to him: "Kill that awful dragon, my dear Camil!". And the silly Camil doesn't know any english. Will you make Camil run to you like a very happy camel and take you on his back on a great adventure 
 on finding his lost glowing eye ( Go to branch 24 ), or will you make him run to Hubert and jump on his back and fly with him until they fade into the skies and and they find true happines there ( Go to branch 26 )
