Setting: Evil Disneyland

You are a young 22 year old currently working a cashier job at Disneyland. It's a relatively normal day, except the fact that outside it's currently the worst thunderstorm in human history. The park is mostly empty, save for the evilest of clients, Hubert. Do you wish to go home (go to branch 1) or do you wish to remain working, thus earning triple your usual bonus salary? (go to branch 2)


1:
On the way home you notice how beautiful the rain is. The water cascades down like silver threads from the sky, dancing on the pavement and painting everything in a soft, ethereal glow. Thunder rumbles like a distant drum, but it doesn’t frighten you—instead, it feels… magical. Almost cinematic.
You pass Sleeping Beauty's Castle, oddly empty, its colors muted under the storm clouds. Then, just as you're about to turn the corner toward the staff exit, something catches your eye. What do you notice? (go to branch 11) A white horse stands alone in front of the castle, soaked but majestic, with a shimmering royal saddle. It looks like it's waiting for you. Around its neck hangs a soggy note that reads: “Take me to her.” (go to branch 12)A glowing figure dances lightly in the rain, barefoot, as if she doesn’t feel the cold or the wet. As you get closer, you realize—it’s a girl in a sparkling blue ballgown. One glass slipper is missing. She looks at you like she already knows who you are.

2:
You chose to remain and work. Hubert crashes out violently seeing your resolve, and transforms into a giant dragon. You are very scared, screaming like a little constipated girl, but then you realise you must make
a dificult choice. Will you use the power of anime and friendship to switch souls and become Hubert, chaining him inside your little body (go to Branch 2.1) or will you use all of your mothers stew to invoke the
 magical camel of bravery, Camil, and face your greatest fears (Go to Branch 22)
 
 11:
The white horse stands in the rain, staring you down like it knows you. A soaked note hangs around its neck:
“Take me to her.” Without thinking, you climb onto the saddle. The moment you do, thunder cracks—and the horse bolts, not through the park, but straight into the haunted forest behind the castle, a place no guest is supposed to go.Branches claw at you as the world around you warps. You pass twisted trees, abandoned parade floats, and rusting animatronics with glowing red eyes. You’re definitely not in Disneyland anymore.Finally, the horse stops at a ruined, overgrown mirror maze, pulsing with violet light. It looks ancient… and alive.The horse vanishes beneath you, and in the reflection of the mirror, you don’t see yourself.You see her—a girl with your face, trapped inside.She mouths:“Get me out before Hubert finds us.” Do you:(branch 13) Step into the mirror to try to rescue your reflection? (branch 15) Run—this is way beyond what you signed up for.

12:
"Can you help me find my prince?" she asks in a meek voice.
You hesitate for a moment, staring at the girl in the blue ballgown. 
"Your prince?" you echo, unsure whether to be amused or concerned. "Cinderella, right? Is this part of some late-night event?" You glance around for any sign of cast members or security.

The girl frowns, tilting her head slightly. "You don’t remember me, do you?"She looks at you with such familiarity, like she’s known you for a long time. Before you can ask what she means, she suddenly grabs your wrist with surprising strength.
"Please," she whispers. "Time is running out. I need to find him before midnight."
Do you agree to help her search for the prince (go to branch 14) or do you refuse, insisting that none of this makes sense? (go to branch 16)

13:
You reach toward the mirror—your reflection staring back, eyes wide with urgency. The moment your fingers touch the glass, it ripples like water and pulls you in.
You're swallowed by darkness.When you wake up, you're no longer in your body. You're inside the mirror world—a twisted, inverted version of the park. Everything’s off. The castle floats upside down. Music plays backward. Time feels... broken.Then you see her—your reflection, now walking around in your real body on the other side of the mirror.
She smirks.“Thanks for the trade.”She turns and vanishes into the real world, leaving you trapped in this nightmare version of Disneyland.And behind you… you hear Hubert’s voice.“You’re just in time for the final show.” Do you: (Branch 17) Search the mirror world for allies and a way out?(Branch 19) Confront Hubert directly—you’re done running.

14:
Cinderella stares, eyes wide—then hurls her glass slipper at your face.  
"Great! Thanks for nothing, asshole!" The shoe bounces off your forehead with a thunk. She storms off into the rain.You sigh, picking up the slipper. It hums—then EXPLODES in glitter and smoke.
A voice booms: "YOU HAVE FAILED THE PRINCESS QUEST. YOUR SOUL BELONGS TO HUBERT."
"Wait, WHAT?!" The ground vanishes. You plummet into a void of elevator music and laughter. Somewhere, Hubert chuckles. "Welcome to Evil Disneyland! No refunds!"
(THE END)

15:
You stare at the mirror—and decide not to go in.
“Nope,” you mutter. “Not today.”The mirror cracks, glowing red, then shatters into nothing. Behind you, the white horse reappears, calm and silent. You climb back on, and it carries you out of the twisted woods.As you cross back into the park, the storm fades. Lights flicker back on. Everything feels... normal again.You glance at the note still on the horse’s neck.“Take me to her.”But now, scrawled beneath it:“Good choice.”The horse vanishes.You clock out—soaked, shaken, but alive.Whatever was behind that mirror… stays there.
The End.

17:
You turn away from the broken mirror and start exploring the twisted mirror world. The sky is upside down, music plays backward, and statues whisper your name. Eventually, you find other trapped souls—former cast members, lost in time. One of them, a girl with glowing eyes, tells you there’s one way out, but only one person can take it. Without hesitation, you step onto a glowing carousel buried beneath vines. As it spins, everything fades. You wake up back in the real park, soaked and alone. The storm is gone. No one remembers anything—but you do. You escaped. And now you know Disneyland hides more than magic.The End.

19: 
You turn toward the darkened path and march straight into the heart of the mirror world. No more running. You find Hubert waiting in the ruined throne room of a twisted castle, grinning like he’s been expecting you. He towers over you, eyes glowing, shadow warping reality around him. But you don’t flinch. With nothing but your courage—and a half-broken souvenir sword—you lunge. The world explodes in light. When it fades, the mirror is gone. So is Hubert. You’re still trapped, but the loop is broken. The curse is over. Evil Disneyland is silent, and you? You’re the last hero standing.
The End.

21:
 You begin channeling the power of anime and friendship, but in the last moments before your attack, you realise you have neither friends nor a subscription to Crunchyroll, and thus you fail. Hubert, initially shocked by your
 violent outburst, now calmed himself and prepares to counterattack. Your situation is dire, and you are now scrambling your brain to figure out how to get out of this dilemma. Suddenly, an idea comes to you,
 what if you could channel your inner dissapointment and use that to hijack Huberts body? (Branch 23). Or you could always just ignore your ideas just how you ignore all your responsibilities, eat one last coconut and log out in real life(Branch 25) 

22:
 Now that you chose to summon the magical Camil, you try to face your greatest fear and destroy Hubert the dragon, which is flying in circles and shooting flames everywhere. Camil, who has two heads and four humps is looking at you 
 with his three yellow glowing eyes and is waiting for you to give him an order. You say to him: "Kill that awful dragon, my dear Camil!". And the silly Camil doesn't know any english. Will you make Camil run to you like a very happy camel and take you on his back on a great adventure 
 on finding his lost glowing eye ( Go to branch 24 ), or will you make him run to Hubert and jump on his back and fly with him until they fade into the skies and and they find true happines there ( Go to branch 26 )


23:
You begin channeling all the dissapointment you harbor deep inside you, and produce a power more immense than the entirety of the milky way galaxy. Using this power, you summon your ultimate kidney stone, that you had when you were 13, 
and launch it at Hubert the Dragon at a speed rivaling the speed of light. Your stone, whom you have named Peter and now love like your own child, pierces Huberts soul, dragging it out of his draconic body, and pulling it 
all the way inside your own. Finally you eject yourself from your body like a nicaraguan pilot in distress, and take your seat as the rightful controller of the dragon's body. Now you have attained unlimited power. 
Will you use it to achieve world peace(Go to branch 27) or will you become the very thing you swore to destroy, and raid the Crunchyroll headquarters to finally obtain that life subscription(Branch 29).
